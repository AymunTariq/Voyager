Normally when a root file is converted to csv, all the data goes into first column of sheet. this is why we copy all the data to a text file and then use text_to_csv to convert it into a proper csv file.

Once that is done,the csv file was used to do agglomerative clustering, each step is explained in the JupyTer notebook, please refer to it for further explanation.

The result of agglomerative clustering has been saved as an image file by the name of "test".
